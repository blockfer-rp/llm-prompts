# Implementation Refactoring Guide

## DIRECTIVE
Please continue with the following PLAN phases:

`$ARGUMENT`

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Core Principles
- Ensure to keep all existing functionality and follow the same patterns and framework, including concise docstrings that explain the framework to help future engineers maintain the code
- Return the **FULL source code** of all modules to update with the new updates. Ensure to keep all core requirements and attributes
- Do **NOT** keep backward compatibility, legacy methods, or fallback functions!
- Return the full source code, production-ready, of Implementation Plan
- Ensure that the code is complete, with no placeholders or partial updates
- The goal is to fix fundamental architectural issues
- Do **NOT** add new features that are not part of the original core requirements

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

### Coverage & Completeness
- **100% function/method/variable coverage:** Retain all code from the original unless specifically told to remove
- **NO placeholders** or "simulate"/"stub" comments
- Provide a **full function inventory checklist** for each file touched, detailing:
  - What stayed the same
  - What changed
  - What is missing (with explicit justification)

## DELIVERABLE FORMAT

### For Each Modified File
1. **Full source code** (production-ready)
2. **Function inventory checklist**
3. **Change justification**

### Quality Standards
- Complete implementation (no partial updates)
- Framework-consistent patterns
- Clear docstrings for maintainability
- No legacy code remnants
