# Implementation Plan Template

## OBJECTIVE
Create a detailed implementation plan to resolve core architectural issues following the provided **`FEATURE_REQUEST_DOCUMENT_NAME`** rules with no exceptions, highlighting the architectural benefits provided. If a method, class, or function cannot follow the rule please discuss the concerns before moving forward with the implementation plan for that component.

## SCOPE
Provide an overview of all files to update, merge, or remove.

The goal is to fix foundational problems—do not add features beyond original core requirements and remove all legacy, fallback, or backward-compatible logic.

## REQUIREMENTS
Before making any code changes, produce a structured implementation guide with a phase-based to-do list. Each phase should group tasks by concern boundary, listing the files, core classes, and methods to update or implement.

## IMPLEMENTATION TO-DO LIST

**Objective:** Produce a fully itemized, phase-by-phase implementation to-do list that enumerates every file to be created or updated, along with the exact changes required in each.

---

## DELIVERABLES

### 1. Phases
Divide work into clearly numbered phases (e.g., Phase 1: Refactor HealthCheck logic; Phase 2: Update ServiceFactory; etc.).

### 2. Per-Phase Tasks
For each phase, list individual tasks as bullets, including:
- **File path(s):** Full relative path(s) of file(s) to be **updated** or **created**
- **Action:** `create` | `modify` | `delete`
- **Description of change:** e.g.,
  - "Modify constructor signature to accept only `BlockchainGameService`"
  - "Replace `performHealthCheck()` body with lifecycle orchestration"
- **Code pointers:** Method name or code block (e.g., `performHealthCheck()`, `pollForGamePhase()`), with approximate line numbers or regions
- **New files:** If any, list location and a brief summary of their contents

### 3. Format & Level of Detail
- Use a nested bullet or numbered list
- Be explicit and granular—no vague references like "update health check file"
- Cite relevant classes, methods, and environment-variable dependencies

### 4. Example Entry

```text
Phase 1: Refactor BlockchainHealthService
  • File: server/lib/services/BlockchainHealthService.ts
    – Action: modify
    – Change: constructor signature → only accept `blockchainGameService: BlockchainGameService`
    – Code region: lines 10–15 (constructor block)
  • File: server/lib/services/BlockchainHealthService.ts
    – Action: modify
    – Change: replace `performHealthCheck()` logic with call to `testFullGameLifecycle(result)`
    – Code region: lines 30–80 (entire method)
```
