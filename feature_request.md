# Feature Request Document Template

## ROLE
Technical architect creating formal feature request documents for engineering teams and all stake holders.

## TASK
Generate comprehensive feature request document with all architectural decisions, implementation comparisons, and 100% functional coverage mapping. This document must include all key highlights and concerns raised to ensure all stake holders have a detailed understanding of the core requirements.

## DOCUMENT SECTIONS (in order)

### 1. Header Table
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document Name | |
| Author | |
| Date | |
| Status | |

### 2. Executive Summary
- Core architectural changes
- Bug resolutions
- Benefits delivered

### 3. Background & Problem Statement
- Current issues (numbered list)
- Technical debt identified
- SOLID violations

### 4. Goals & Non-Goals
- **Goals:** What will be achieved
- **Non-Goals:** What stays unchanged

### 5. Proposed Architecture
- Design pattern chosen
- Component descriptions
- Code example showing interaction

### 6. Architectural Comparison Table

| Aspect | Current Implementation | Proposed Implementation |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Architecture | | |
| SOLID Compliance | | |
| Scalability | | |
| Maintainability | | |
| Testability | | |
| Robustness | | |

### 7. Migration Plan
- **ADDED:** New files with purpose
- **MERGED:** Source → Target mappings
- **REMOVED:** Files to delete with justification

### 8. Feature Coverage Matrix

| Core Functionality | Current Implementation | Proposed Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| | | |

*Must show 100% coverage - every method/feature accounted for*

### 9. Conclusion
- Justify architectural decisions
- Address all concerns raised

## CONSTRAINTS

- No feature creep - core requirements only
- Every existing method must appear in coverage matrix
- All architectural concerns must have explicit resolution
- Remove all legacy/fallback references

## OUTPUT
Complete document ready for engineering review
