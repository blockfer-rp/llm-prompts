ROLE ▸ Senior architect specializing in SOLID principles and Clean Architecture for large-scale systems.

TASK ▸ Analyze architectural discrepancies and deliver top 3 design solutions that address root feature requirements and issues while integrating with existing architecture.

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
• Identify root architectural problem (not symptoms)
• Map all affected components and dependencies
• Document integration points with existing system
• Flag breaking changes to dependencies

SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Each solution must include:
• Design pattern applied
• SOLID principles addressed
• Integration strategy
• File hierarchy changes
• Dependency impact assessment

DELIVERABLES:

1. **Root Problem Analysis**
   - Core architectural issue
   - Affected components list
   - Current violation of principles

2. **Solution Comparison Matrix**
   ```
   | Solution | Pattern | SOLID Fix | Integration Complexity | Breaking Changes |
   |----------|---------|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
   | #1       |         |           | Low/Med/High           | Yes/No + details |
   | #2       |         |           | Low/Med/High           | Yes/No + details |
   | #3       |         |           | Low/Med/High           | Yes/No + details |
   ```

3. **Per-Solution Details**
   For each solution provide:
   • **Pattern:** Specific design pattern used
   • **Integration Points:** Exact files/interfaces affected
   • **File Hierarchy:** 
     ```
     /component
       ├── new-file.ts
       └── modified-file.ts
     ```
   • **Dependencies:** What breaks, what adapts
   • **Risk Assessment:** Critical concerns

4. **Architectural Concerns**
   • Design direction issues
   • Alternative architecture options to consider
   • Long-term maintainability risks

5. **Recommendation**
   - Best solution with justification
   - Migration complexity score (1-10)
   - Implementation timeline estimate

CONSTRAINTS:
• Solutions must follow existing framework patterns
• No over-engineering - practical solutions only
• Preserve all current functionality
• Consider future extensibility
